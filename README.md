# My Personal Café

**The Proposal** 


This personal café is an application that allows a user to place a coffee order as they would in a regular coffee shop
but instead virtually. This coffee order could contain up to multiple customizable drinks as well as delicious pastries
to go alongside with it. Moreover, it would have enhanced features, such as showing which drinks and food items work
well together. An example of this is having a regular medium roast and latte in your order and needing a food item, the
simulation would then recommend an oat fudge bar or a brownie as dark roast coffee is best paired with rich and creamy
food like chocolate. This application would not only allow coffee shops to spend their hard-earned money elsewhere, such
as towards improving their equipment to enhance coffee quality or to appeal to more customers through renovation, but it
would also allow consumers to save a lot more time and reduce chances of human inaccuracy when ordering at registers in
a café.

This café is of big interest to me as I am a coffee shop barista myself. Providing customers with the best experience
possible is what I aspire to do and what better way is there when I can provide them with an application that does just
that. An application that allows a virtual ordering system is just what any coffee shop needs when they want to put
their full effort into providing the best quality of food and beverages.
