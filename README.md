# My Personal Café

**The Proposal**

This personal café is an application that allows a user to place a coffee order as they would in a regular coffee shop
but instead virtually. This coffee order could contain up to multiple customizable drinks, such as changing the sugar,
toppings and the milk that it comes with. This application would not only allow coffee shops to spend their hard-earned
money elsewhere, such as towards improving their equipment to enhance coffee quality or to appeal to more customers
through renovation, but it would also allow consumers to save a lot more time and reduce chances of human inaccuracy
when ordering at registers in a café.

This café is of big interest to me as I am a coffee shop barista myself. Providing customers with the best experience
possible is what I aspire to do and what better way is there when I can provide them with an application that does just
that. An application that allows a virtual ordering system is just what any coffee shop needs when they want to put
their full effort into providing the best quality of food and beverages.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to customize my coffee such as:
    - milk
    - sugar
    - toppings

- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple beverage items onto my order

- As a user, I want to be able to get rid of any drinks I don't want before I check out

- As a user, I would like to know the price of each good as well as my total order price

- As a user, I would like to be automatically applied for discounts (ex. 10% chance of half price off your order)

- As a user, I want to be able to save all the drinks I have ordered up till that point, including customisations.

- As a user, I would like to be able to load up my coffee order and continue from where I left off in the transaction

## Phase 4: Task 3

If given the time to refactor my code from the start this is what I would do:

- Make some abstract methods in the abstract classes to be regular methods so that if new drinks are added they are
  easier to implement and can get rid of methods in the drink classes I already have

- make a refactored method for milk, sugar and toppings as they all share similar concepts
