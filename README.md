# My Personal Café

**The Proposal**

This personal café is an application that allows a user to place 
a coffee order as they would in a regular coffee shop but instead 
virtually. This coffee order could contain up to multiple customizable
drinks as well as delicious pastries to go alongside with it. Moreover, 
it would have enhanced features, such as showing which drinks and food items 
work well together. An example of this is having a regular medium roast 
and latte in your order and needing a food item, the simulation would then
recommend an oat fudge bar or a brownie as dark roast coffee is best paired with
rich and creamy food like chocolate. This application 
would not only allow coffee shops to spend their hard-earned money elsewhere,
such as towards improving their equipment to enhance coffee quality or to 
appeal to more customers through renovation, but it would also allow consumers
to save a lot more time and reduce chances of human inaccuracy when ordering 
at registers in a café.

This café is of big interest to me as I am a coffee shop barista myself. Providing 
customers with the best experience possible is what I aspire to do and what better
way is there when I can provide them with an application that does just that. An
application that allows a virtual ordering system is just what any coffee shop needs
when they want to put their full effort into providing the best quality of food 
and beverages.
